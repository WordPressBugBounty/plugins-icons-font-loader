### User Feedback

#### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [It just works!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-just-works-743/)

❛❛***I don’t know why there is no one else reviewed this plugin aside from the developer. I was skeptical at first because it was last updated 1 month ago, but this plugin has solved my 3-day struggle with using Flaticon. Their icons are awesome, but like what the developer of this plugin has said, implementing the icons on your WordPress site can be tricky.***

***Big “THANK YOU” to this plugin for preserving my sanity.***

***This plugin’s interface is a little too simplified and would benefit from the example on YouTube (also uploaded by this developer).***❜❜
